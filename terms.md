## Category Theory

A category consists of objects and arrows/morphisms.

### Object (in FP terms)

A value with a specific type

### Morphism (in FP terms)

A function

---

## Isomorphic

A function is isomorphic if it has an inverse function.

e.g.

- `f: x -> y`
- `g: y -> x`

Such that `f . g = id(y)` and `g . f = id(x)`
