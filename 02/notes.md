# Chapter 2

- Expression: values, combinations of values, and/or functions applied to value
- Expressions evaluate to a result: trivial for values - evaluate to themselves

- Normal form: no more evaluation to do - e.g. 1 + 1 in normal form is 2 (1 + 1 is reducible, but 2 is not)
- "Redex": a reducible expression

- Operators are functions that can be used in an infix style. Operators are a subset of functions.
